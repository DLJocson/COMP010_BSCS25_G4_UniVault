        <p>
          In compliance with the requirements of the Data Privacy Act, I hereby
          give my consent to the BDO Group, consisting of BDO Unibank, Inc. and
          its subsidiaries (the members of the BDO Group may be accessed at
          <a href="#">https://www.bdo.com.ph/privacy-statement</a> ) to process,
          collect, store, use, or disclose my personal information or sensitive
          personal information obtained from me in the course of my
          transaction/s with the BDO Group. I understand and agree that these
          information may be disclosed to its members for know-your-client,
          cross-selling, marketing, or profiling (manual or automatic) purposes
          to offer and provide new or related products and services of the BDO
          Group. Further, I hereby give my consent to any member of the BDO
          Group to process, collect, use, store, share or disclose my personal
          information or sensitive personal information to third parties for
          legitimate purposes, or to provide services to me or implement
          transactions which I may request, allow, or authorize.

          <br />
          <br />

          I confirm that I understand and agree that my information may continue
          to be processed, collected, used, stored, or disclosed for ten (10)
          years from my last transaction date with any member of the BDO Group
          or the expiration of the retention limits set by applicable laws,
          whichever comes later.

          <br />
          <br />

          I hereby acknowledge and understand that should I wish to withdraw my
          consent to the collection and processing of my personal information or
          sensitive personal information about new or related products and
          services of the BDO Group, or to access, update, or correct certain
          data in this form, I may communicate directly with the relevant member
          of the BDO Group’s Data Protection Officer through the email address
          found at <a href="">https://www.bdo.com.ph/privacy-statement</a>. I
          further acknowledge and understand that I may access and read the BDO
