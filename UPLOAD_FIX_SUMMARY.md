# Image Upload Fix Summary

## 🐛 **Issue Identified**
Users could not upload images on registration pages 6 and 7 due to missing JavaScript file references.

## 🔧 **Root Cause**
During the repository cleanup, `upload-utils.js` was moved from `1_frontend/Registration-Customer/` to `1_frontend/shared/` but the HTML file references were not updated.

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Updated Script References**
**Fixed Files:**
- `1_frontend/Registration-Customer/registration6.html`
- `1_frontend/Registration-Customer/registration7.html`

**Change:**
```html
<!-- Before -->
<script src="upload-utils.js"></script>

<!-- After -->
<script src="../shared/upload-utils.js"></script>
```

### **2. Enhanced Debugging**
Added comprehensive logging to `upload-utils.js`:
- Upload handler initialization tracking
- File selection logging
- Detailed error reporting
- Missing element warnings

### **3. Verified Backend**
✅ Upload endpoint `/upload` is working correctly  
✅ File validation is functioning (JPEG, PNG, PDF only)  
✅ 5MB file size limit enforced  
✅ Upload directory exists with proper permissions  

## 📋 **Upload Features Confirmed Working**

1. **File Type Validation**: Only JPEG, PNG, and PDF files allowed
2. **File Size Validation**: 5MB maximum file size
3. **Image Previews**: Automatic preview generation for images
4. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for validation failures
5. **Progress Indication**: Upload progress feedback
6. **Local Storage**: File paths stored for form submission
7. **UI Feedback**: Visual feedback with success/error states

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

1. **Navigate to upload pages:**
   - http://localhost:3000/Registration-Customer/registration6.html
   - http://localhost:3000/Registration-Customer/registration7.html

2. **Test upload functionality:**
   - Try uploading valid image files (JPEG, PNG)
   - Try uploading invalid files (should show error)
   - Try uploading files > 5MB (should show error)

3. **Check console for debugging:**
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Watch for initialization and upload logs
   - Verify no JavaScript errors
