# üè† UniVault Localhost Setup & Database Persistence Validation Guide

## ‚úÖ System Status: **READY FOR LOCAL TESTING**

Your UniVault system is configured and ready for localhost testing. Here's your complete validation guide.

---

## üöÄ **STEP 1: Launch the System**

### **1.1 Start the Backend Server**

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd "C:\Users\louie\Documents\Github\COMP010_BSCS25_G4_UniVault\2_backend"

# Start the server
npm start
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Connected to MySQL database!
Server running on http://localhost:3000
```

**If you see errors:**
- **Database Connection Error**: Check if MySQL is running and credentials in `.env` are correct
- **Port Already in Use**: Change PORT in `.env` or kill existing process

### **1.2 Verify Server is Running**

Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:3000/api**

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Welcome to the UniVault API!",
  "endpoints": [
    { "method": "GET", "path": "/" },
    { "method": "POST", "path": "/register", "description": "Register a new user" },
    { "method": "POST", "path": "/login", "description": "Login as a user" },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## üóÑÔ∏è **STEP 2: Verify Database Setup**

### **2.1 Check Database Existence**

Connect to MySQL and verify the database exists:

**Using MySQL Command Line:**
```sql
mysql -u root -p
SHOW DATABASES;
USE univault_schema;
SHOW TABLES;
```

**Using MySQL Workbench:**
1. Connect to localhost
2. Look for `univault_schema` database
3. Expand to see tables

**Expected Tables:**
```
- CUSTOMER
- CUSTOMER_ADDRESS
- CUSTOMER_CONTACT_DETAILS
- CUSTOMER_ID
- CUSTOMER_EMPLOYMENT_INFORMATION
- CUSTOMER_FUND_SOURCE
- CUSTOMER_WORK_NATURE
- CUSTOMER_ALIAS
- [Reference tables: CIVIL_STATUS_TYPE, ADDRESS_TYPE, etc.]
```

### **2.2 Test Database Connection from Backend**

```bash
# Test database connectivity
cd 2_backend
node -e "require('dotenv').config(); const {testConnection} = require('./config/database'); testConnection();"
```

**Expected Output:** `Connected to MySQL database!`

## üîç **STEP 4: Validate Data Persistence**

### **4.1 Real-Time Monitoring**

**Monitor Backend Console:**
While registering, watch the backend console for:
```
POST /register
Database insertion logs
Transaction commit
CIF number: [generated number]
```

### **4.2 Database Verification Queries**

**After completing registration, run these queries:**

#### **A. Find Latest Customer Registration**
```sql
USE univault_schema;

-- Get the most recent customer
SELECT 
    cif_number,
    customer_type,
    CONCAT(customer_first_name, ' ', customer_last_name) as full_name,
    customer_username,
    birth_date,
    customer_creation_timestamp
FROM customer 
ORDER BY customer_creation_timestamp DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

#### **B. Verify All Data Tables**
```sql
-- Set the CIF number from previous query
SET @latest_cif = (SELECT MAX(cif_number) FROM customer);

-- 1. Customer basic info
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE cif_number = @latest_cif;

-- 2. Address information
SELECT 
    address_type_code,
    CONCAT(address_street, ', ', address_barangay, ', ', address_city) as address
FROM customer_address 
WHERE cif_number = @latest_cif;

-- 3. Contact details
SELECT 
    contact_type_code,
    contact_value,
    CASE contact_type_code 
        WHEN 'CT01' THEN 'Mobile Phone'
        WHEN 'CT03' THEN 'Email'
        ELSE 'Other'
    END as contact_type
FROM customer_contact_details 
WHERE cif_number = @latest_cif;

-- 4. Employment information
SELECT 
    employer_business_name,
    position_code,
    income_monthly_gross
FROM customer_employment_information 
WHERE cif_number = @latest_cif;

-- 5. ID documents with file paths
SELECT 
    id_type_code,
    id_number,
    id_storage as uploaded_file_path,
    id_issue_date,
    id_expiry_date
FROM customer_id 
WHERE cif_number = @latest_cif;

-- 6. Fund sources
SELECT 
    fund_source_code
FROM customer_fund_source 
WHERE cif_number = @latest_cif;
```

#### **C. Data Completeness Check**
```sql
-- Count records across all tables
SELECT 
    'customer' as table_name,
    COUNT(*) as records
FROM customer WHERE cif_number = @latest_cif
UNION ALL
SELECT 'addresses', COUNT(*) FROM customer_address WHERE cif_number = @latest_cif
UNION ALL
SELECT 'contacts', COUNT(*) FROM customer_contact_details WHERE cif_number = @latest_cif
UNION ALL
SELECT 'employment', COUNT(*) FROM customer_employment_information WHERE cif_number = @latest_cif
UNION ALL
SELECT 'id_documents', COUNT(*) FROM customer_id WHERE cif_number = @latest_cif
UNION ALL
SELECT 'fund_sources', COUNT(*) FROM customer_fund_source WHERE cif_number = @latest_cif;
```

### **4.3 File Upload Verification**

**Check Uploaded Files:**
```bash
# Navigate to uploads directory
cd "C:\Users\louie\Documents\Github\COMP010_BSCS25_G4_UniVault\2_backend\uploads"

# List uploaded files (should see timestamp-prefixed files)
dir

# Expected files:
# 1234567890123-front-id-1.jpg
# 1234567890123-back-id-1.jpg
# 1234567890123-front-id-2.jpg
# 1234567890123-back-id-2.jpg
```

## üß™ **STEP 5: Test Login System**

### **5.1 Test Login with Registered Credentials**

1. Go to: **http://localhost:3000/Registration-Customer/login.html**
2. Enter the credentials you used in Step 12:
   ```
   Username: johndoe123
   Password: SecurePassword123!
   ```
3. Click "Login"

**Expected Behavior:**
- Successful login should redirect to customer dashboard
- Backend should return CIF number

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** There's a known issue with the password field in login.js that may need manual fixing.
