## üîç **STEP 4: Verify Data Was Saved (Choose Your Method)**

### **Method 1: MySQL Workbench (Recommended)**
1. Open MySQL Workbench
2. Connect to localhost
3. Open `univault_schema` database
4. Run this query:

```sql
-- Check if registration was saved
USE univault_schema;

SELECT 
    cif_number,
    CONCAT(customer_first_name, ' ', customer_last_name) as full_name,
    customer_username,
    birth_date,
    customer_creation_timestamp
FROM customer 
ORDER BY customer_creation_timestamp DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

### **Method 2: MySQL Command Line**
```bash
mysql -u root -p
```
Then run:
```sql
USE univault_schema;
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_customers FROM customer;
SELECT MAX(cif_number) as latest_customer FROM customer;
```

### **Method 3: phpMyAdmin (if installed)**
1. Go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin
2. Select `univault_schema` database
3. Click on `customer` table
4. Browse data to see latest entry

---

## üìä **STEP 5: Complete Data Verification Query**

**Run this comprehensive query to verify ALL data was saved:**

```sql
USE univault_schema;

-- Get latest customer CIF
SET @latest_cif = (SELECT MAX(cif_number) FROM customer);

-- 1. Customer Basic Info
SELECT '=== CUSTOMER BASIC INFO ===' as section;
SELECT 
    cif_number,
    customer_type,
    CONCAT(customer_first_name, ' ', customer_middle_name, ' ', customer_last_name) as full_name,
    customer_username,
    birth_date,
    gender,
    civil_status_code,
    citizenship,
    tax_identification_number,
    customer_creation_timestamp
FROM customer 
WHERE cif_number = @latest_cif;

-- 2. Contact Details
SELECT '=== CONTACT DETAILS ===' as section;
SELECT 
    contact_type_code,
    contact_value,
    CASE contact_type_code 
        WHEN 'CT01' THEN 'Mobile Phone'
        WHEN 'CT02' THEN 'Landline'
        WHEN 'CT03' THEN 'Email'
        ELSE 'Other'
    END as contact_type
FROM customer_contact_details 
WHERE cif_number = @latest_cif;

-- 3. Address Info
SELECT '=== ADDRESS INFO ===' as section;
SELECT 
    address_type_code,
    CONCAT(
        IFNULL(address_unit, ''), ' ',
        IFNULL(address_building, ''), ', ',
        IFNULL(address_street, ''), ', ',
        IFNULL(address_barangay, ''), ', ',
        IFNULL(address_city, ''), ', ',
        IFNULL(address_province, ''), ' ',
        IFNULL(address_zip_code, '')
    ) as full_address
FROM customer_address 
WHERE cif_number = @latest_cif;

-- 4. Employment Info
SELECT '=== EMPLOYMENT INFO ===' as section;
SELECT 
    employer_business_name,
    position_code,
    income_monthly_gross,
    employment_status
FROM customer_employment_information 
WHERE cif_number = @latest_cif;

-- 5. ID Documents
SELECT '=== ID DOCUMENTS ===' as section;
SELECT 
    id_type_code,
    id_number,
    id_storage as file_path,
    id_issue_date,
    id_expiry_date
FROM customer_id 
WHERE cif_number = @latest_cif
ORDER BY id_creation_timestamp;

-- 6. Fund Sources
SELECT '=== FUND SOURCES ===' as section;
SELECT fund_source_code FROM customer_fund_source WHERE cif_number = @latest_cif;

-- 7. Data Completeness Summary
SELECT '=== SUMMARY ===' as section;
SELECT 
    CONCAT('Customer CIF: ', @latest_cif) as info,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer_address WHERE cif_number = @latest_cif) as addresses_count,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer_contact_details WHERE cif_number = @latest_cif) as contacts_count,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer_id WHERE cif_number = @latest_cif) as ids_count,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer_employment_information WHERE cif_number = @latest_cif) as employment_count;
```

### **Expected Results:**
- **Customer Basic Info**: 1 record with Maria Santos details
- **Contact Details**: 2-3 records (phone, landline, email)
- **Address Info**: 1-2 records (home address, possibly work address)
- **Employment Info**: 1 record with Tech Solutions Inc.
- **ID Documents**: 4 records (front/back of 2 IDs) with file paths
- **Fund Sources**: 1+ records
- **Summary**: All counts > 0

## üìÅ **STEP 6: Verify File Uploads**

**Check if uploaded files are saved:**
```bash
# Navigate to uploads directory
cd "C:\Users\louie\Documents\Github\COMP010_BSCS25_G4_UniVault\2_backend\uploads"

# List files (Windows)
dir

# You should see files like:
# 1735084123456-front-id-1.jpg
# 1735084123456-back-id-1.jpg
# 1735084123456-front-id-2.jpg
# 1735084123456-back-id-2.jpg
```

---

## üîê **STEP 7: Test Login System**

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/Registration-Customer/login.html
2. Enter credentials:
   ```
   Username: mariasantos90
   Password: MySecurePass123!
   ```
3. Click "Login"

**Expected:** Successful login and redirect to dashboard

---

## üö® **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Server Won't Start**
```bash
# Check if port is in use
netstat -ano | findstr :3000

# Kill process if needed
taskkill /PID [process_id] /F

# Or change port in .env file
```

### **Database Connection Error**
```bash
# Start MySQL service
net start mysql

# Check MySQL is running
services.msc
```

### **Registration Fails**
- Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
- Check backend console for error messages
- Ensure all required fields are filled
- Verify file uploads completed

### **No Data in Database**
- Check backend console for SQL errors
- Verify MySQL user has INSERT permissions
- Check if all required fields were submitted
