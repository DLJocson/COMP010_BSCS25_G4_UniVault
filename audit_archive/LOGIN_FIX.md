# Login System Fix Required

## Issue Found
In `1_frontend/Registration-Customer/login.js` line 21, there's a redacted password field name that needs to be corrected to `customer_password` to match the backend API.

## Fix Required
Change the login request body to use the correct field name:
```javascript
body: JSON.stringify({ customer_username: username, customer_password: password })
```

This will ensure the login system works correctly with the backend authentication route.
