# 🗓️ Date Input Behavior Fixes - ID Verification Pages

## ✅ **FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### 🔸 **1. Input Sequence Bug - FIXED**
**Problem**: Users couldn't input day unless both month AND year were selected  
**Solution**: Implemented Month → Day → Year flow

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Day dropdown populates immediately after month selection
- ✅ Year selection is no longer required for day options
- ✅ Intuitive user flow: Month first, then Day, then Year

### 🔸 **2. Year Limitation Bug - FIXED**
**Problem**: Expiry dates limited to 2025  
**Solution**: Extended range to 2050

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ **Issue Years**: Current year down to 1900 (for past dates)
- ✅ **Expiry Years**: Current year up to 2050 (for future dates)
- ✅ Covers IDs with long validity periods

### 🔸 **3. February Leap Year Support - ENHANCED**
**Problem**: February days varied based on year calculation  
**Solution**: Always show 29 days for February

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ February always shows 29 days to support leap years
- ✅ Users can select Feb 29 regardless of year
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all date inputs

### **registration6.html**
- Updated `populateYears()` function to differentiate issue vs expiry years

## 📅 **Year Ranges**

### **Issue Dates (Past)**
- **Range**: 1900 → Current Year
- **Use**: When the ID was issued
- **Logic**: Can't issue IDs in the future

### **Expiry Dates (Future)**
- **Range**: Current Year → 2050
- **Use**: When the ID expires
- **Logic**: IDs expire in the future, extended to 2050 for long-term validity
